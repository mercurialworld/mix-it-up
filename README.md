My personal scripts for the [Mix it Up](https://mixitupapp.com/) streaming bot software. 

If you're a Beat Saber player, you might mainly be here for the `requests` folder. This queue system uses TheBlackParrot's [DumbRequestManager](https://github.com/TheBlackParrot/DumbRequestManager). ~~haha get it? i'm working with DRM~~
